Summary: Moving from a middle sized city in the deep south of Spain to the third biggest urban area in Europe is a big change. In this post I write about the pros and cons of living in a city like Madrid.

# The story

Let's go straight to the point. At the moment of writing this lines, I have been living in Madrid for 5 months. I grew
up in a small village and moved to the closest urban area (Seville) when I started college. I spent nine years there of 
both hard study and work. I had my entire life in Seville: an apartment, a car, all my stuff, my girlfriend, my family, 
(most of) my friends.

Of the nine total years spent in Seville, first three years were the process of __*falling in love with the city*__, 
middle three were a time of __*growth, stability and city mastering*__. Last three were __*apathy and stagnation*__.

I am not going to bore you about all details about why I decided to change Seville for Madrid. I decided to focus on the
best for my professional career and (unavoidably) I am making some sacrifices along the way.

## Data Science ecosystem

### Madrid
In spain, if you want to do real Data Science, you **have to** go Madrid (or Barcelona). There is nothing much to do 
outside these two cities in the Spanish Data Science scene. Over the last 10 years these two cities, but specially
Madrid concentrates a high flux of young and high qualified professionals from other parts of the country running away 
from the financial crisis which was less severe in big cities with strong companies.  

Most companies that demand data science & advanced analytics services in Spain have headquarters in Madrid, so data 
professionals are in high demand here. So if you want to be surrounded by people talking about Data Pipelines, Machine 
Learning Models and all data buzzwords this is your place. You will learn a lot, I swear. Best projects are in Madrid, 
and also faster career progression.  

### Seville
The reality is that Data Science ecosystem in Seville is almost nonexistent. Region economy relies mostly on **tourism, 
agriculture, public sector** and some industry which struggle to survive and keep competitiveness despite low salaries 
and terrible working conditions ([Abengoa][Abengoa], [Airbus][Airbus], etc.). Of course there are some exceptions, brave 
companies trying to do cool things and initiatives like [Databeers Sevilla][Databeers].  

My advice to any new graduate who want a career in Data Science is to move outside Seville as soon as he finishes 
his / her studies. You can expect probably pseudo-data-science projects (for example, classical business intelligence 
projects masked as data science, with tons of SQL and little to zero modeling) and a very slow career and salary 
progression which leads to dissatisfaction and boredom.  

## Salaries and working environment

### Madrid
Salaries are higher in Madrid for the same position (I am focusing in qualified jobs but probably It 
can be extended to other kind of jobs). Working environment is also better. This is the direct cause of the 
[supply and demand law][supply_demand]. As data professionals are high in demand wages are pushed up and employee have 
a higher negotiation power. Companies take care of their employees because it is not easy to replace and there is a 
fierce competition between companies to attract and retain best talent. In the last years Spanish companies are also 
facing competition from foreign firms 'stealing' their employees offering better salaries and more flexibility.

* Provincialism
* Overtime
