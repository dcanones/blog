Headline: Why and How am I blogging?
Status: draft

#Welcome!
This is the very first content of this blog and I am going to try to make a proper introduction and explain some things.

##Why am I blogging?
Because I have interesting things to share with you, of course.

More than one year ago, I got out of the drawer of memories the coding skills I learned during my studies, gave them a new taste (switched from C to Python) and started to learn Data Science and Machine Learning like a crazy in my free time.

Now, one year later, I have switched from pure consultancy (word + excel + power point) to develop machine learning models in my full time job as a consultant, and I am also starting my own business with some partners.

This is the place where I am going to write much of the results I am getting from analyzing datasets (I already have a plug-in installed to do that properly).

I have also realized that there is never enough material on the internet for newcomers data science students, that is why I will also write some tutorials, specially about those simple things that gave me more problems in the beginning of this adventure.

If I have time, I will also write about my views about the present and the future, and how new business models, artificial intelligence and automation are going to shape in sooner than you may think.

##Why Pelican?
You may have probably realized but this web is NOT a WordPress Blog. I have nothing against WordPress and probably, for blogging, is a much more comfortable platform for beginners. Rather than using WP, this web is made using an Static Site generator written in Python and called Pelican. It takes more time to understand how pelican works, but (imho) it worth it:
 
 * Static Sites are faster
 * Cheaper
 * To some extent, more customizable.
 * You need to write some code to set things up
 
There are other Static Sites solutions written in other languages (like Jekyll, using Ruby), but as I am a big fan of Python language Pelican was the straightforward option for me.
 
This blog is also my first experience using some AWS services like S3, Route53 and CloudFront, so it serves also as a practice and learning experience for me.
