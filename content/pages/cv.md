## Data Scientist

## Summary

More than 3 years of experience in Data Science and Consultancy. I help companies and institutions to solve complex
problems applying data-driven solutions. I love a well and carefully done job.

My main working tool is the Python Data Science stack (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.). Experienced
with Big Data and distributed computing tools (Hadoop ecosystem).

I am also an open source advocate and altruistically collaborate on software development and events. 
I invest a great amount of my free time studying and trying new things.

## Experience
__Data Scientist, [Kernel Analytics][ka] (October 2017 - Today):__  
At this moment I am full time employed by Kernel Analytics, a boutique Data Science consultancy firm. We help our
customers to make better decisions taking advantage of data and advanced analytics techniques. We work for top spanish
and international companies.

- Responsibilities: designing and implementing **data pipelines**, performing **exploratory data analysis**,
training **machine learning models**, **communicating results** using dashboards, visualizations and presentations. 
Handling large amounts of data using **Big Data** technologies.

- Environment: Python Data Science stack, Hadoop ecosystem, Relational Databases.

__Data Scientist (R&D), [Grupo Servinform][svf] (September 2016 - October 2017):__  
Worked as researcher Data Scientist in a data driven research project awarded with EU R&D funds. This project was
the result of a collaboration with [IWT2][iwt2], a research group from the University of Seville.

- Responsibilities: designed **data pipelines** using a **micro-services** approach, wrote large parts of the **web app
 backend**, implemented a **recommendation system** and **natural language processing** applied to a search engine, 
 wrote technical documentation.
 
- Environment: Python Data Science stack, Python Web Development stack, Relational Databases, Agile.

__Python Engineer & Co-Founder, Glycerine (January 2017 - January 2018):__  
Glycerine was an entrepreneurship and learning project consisting on an Instagram account automation system ‘as a
service’; a bot that impersonates the user and mimics his behavior resulting in having a robotic 'community manager'
working 24/7 for an instagram account. At this moment the project is cancelled due to Instagram efforts to stop this
kind of bot-based products and the growing difficulty to find suitable project collaborators. We will open source most
of source code in the near future.

- Responsibilities: As tech co-founder, I was responsible of all aspects related to technology like
**architecting, infrastructure provisioning, developing, deploying, operations, implementing new
features based on beta testers’ feedback and bug fixing**.

- Environment: Python Web Development Stack, AWS, Relational Databases.

__Junior Consultant, [Grupo Servinform][svf] (January 2016 - September 2016):__  
As a Junior IT Consultant, I participated in relevant projects at the Innovation and Consultancy department, 
where I had to be very polyvalent, performing different tasks depending on the project and its stage. 

My responsibilities comprised: functional analysis, data wrangling and analysis, writing technical documentation 
and offers, making reports and presentations, attending meetings, visiting clients, among many others.

- Main functional analyst in the biggest Robotic Process Automation project of the company with a major Spanish 
telecom company as client.

- I collaborated with my seniors generating ideas and writing the technical part of the memory to start a new R&D 
project, publicly funded by the European Union with a positive result.

__Intern, [Grupo Servinform][svf] (February 2015 - December 2015):__  
As an Intern I had the opportunity to learn the way of work and best practices in the technology consultancy business 
from the best. I participated in several projects and handled responsibilities from the very first moment, becoming a 
valuable resource for my seniors.

- Participated in Robotic Process Automation project for major Spanish book retail company, resulting in a reduction 
of average operating time (AOT) of 70%.

- Participated in Operational Improvement project for major Spanish financial company, applying Lean Management 
techniques.

- I got involved as intern in several projects as support staff where I performed several tasks like creating data 
models and visual reporting dashboards in Qlik, detailing system requirements, customer support by phone, or 
translating offers to English language among others.
