## Summary

Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of experience helping companies and institutions solving 
complex problems using data analytics solutions. I have successfully completed projects ranging from predictive 
modeling to data pipelines designing for both enterprises and startups.

I have a broad experience using Python Data Science toolkit (pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, PySpark, etc.)and 
work with large amounts of data ($\sim$GB, TB) in a daily basis, so I am also experienced with Big Data and distributed 
computing tools (Hadoop Ecosystem: Spark, Hive, Impala, etc.) as well as parallel computing ones (GPU accelerated 
computing).

I am creator of products like [The Moderator Guru](https://moderator-guru.com), a Natural Language Processing tool that 
automatically spots and classifies offensive text content.

I Revitalized [DataTau][datatau], one of the most important websites to share Data Science news, articles, 
and have discussions. [Open sourced][open] the site code on GitHub and maintain the project.

I am member and supporter of the startup community and [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) Community 
Ambassador for Madrid.

## Experience

### Senior Data Scientist, [Pragsis Bidoop][pb]  (7/2018 - Today): 

* __Tasks__:
    * Development of Machine Learning models using traditional (scikit-learn, XGBoost, lightGBM) and Deep Learning 
    (TensorFlow, Keras) frameworks
	* Scaling Machine Learning models from prototyping to production using distributed and parallel computing (Spark, 
	Dask, Celery)
	* Orchestrating data pipelines using Apache Airflow
	* Leveraging Python toolkit for Data Science to extract valuable information from Data and explain it through 
	visualizations and reports using among other tools pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh, Seaborn, etc.
	* Development of Computer Vision solutions using Google Edge TPUs, Nvidia GPUs, Tensorflow and OpenCV

* __Achievements__:
    * Improved power production forecasting error in 10 percentage points for a cluster of 13 wind farms (about 1GW 
    total managed power) located in Washington, USA, resulting in important savings for our client
    * Developed a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for Amazon Web Services DeepRacer League and became member of the 
    winning team (Gold, Silver and Copper positions)
    * Developed a live tracking system for detecting people using Computer Vision techniques optimized for low 
    consumption hardware requirements (Google Edge TPU, Raspberry Pi)
    
### Lead Teacher, [IronHack][ih]  (7/2019 - Today): 

Lead Teacher in one of the best Data Science schools worldwide, combining both theoretical and
technical stack to build the future generation of Data Scientists. My most important asset is my link
and experience with the Real World as I don’t spend more of 50% of my time in academia.


### Data Scientist, [Kernel Analytics][ka] (now BCG Gamma)  (10/2017 - 7/2018):

* __Tasks__:
    * Development of Machine Learning models using traditional (scikit-learn) and Big Data (Spark MLlib) frameworks
    * Designing custom KPIs based on customers needs and data availability
    * Designing data pipelines able to ingest data from heterogeneous inputs into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
    * Orchestrating data pipeline executions using Apache Airflow
    * Extraction of insights from customers data and creation of meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib, ggplot2, 
    Seaborn, Plotly and Bokeh
    * Creating interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash and Microsoft PowerBI
    
* __Achievements__:
    * Developed a Customer Experience Management framework for a successful Mobile Operator. Designed pipeline from 
    ingesting 3G/4G antennas data to creating a model to relate Customer Experience with Churn and Complaints, resulting 
    into our client being able to monitor its mobile network infrastructure impact in Customer Experience
    * Developed a predictive model for a well known Mobile Operator able to predict users complaints based on 
    consumption patterns and user personal profile, resulting into our client being able to automate part of support 
    process
    
### Maintainer, [DataTau][datatau]  (6/2019 - Today):

* __Tasks__:
    * Web development with Django (Python)
	* Management and maintenance of Open Source project (issues, roadmap, pull requests, etc.)
	* Promoting the site in tech forums and communities
    * Hosting management in personal datacenter

* __Achievements__:
